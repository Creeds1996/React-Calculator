# React Calculator

I created this calculator with React in an afternoon to refresh my knowledge. It currently supports basic functionality such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

You can also perform operations on the result by selecting an operator once a result has been calculated.

The calculator is simple to use.

- Enter first number.
- Select operator.
- Enter second number.
- Press equals/numpadEnter to display the result.

To reset the calculator simply enter new numbers once a result has been calculated.

To perform operations on the result simply select an operator and secondary number then press equals/NumpadEnter.

## Controls

### Mouse

Pretty self explanatory. Point and click on the button that corresponds with your desired input.

### Keyboard

Users can currently interact with the calculator with the use of the numpad and digits on top of the keyboard. Operators on the keyboard work with enter being the equivalent of equals.
